0.96  Sat Jul 07 18:27:25 2007 UTC
    - Changed threads::shared::share(\$nchildren) to

0.95  Tue Aug 10 21:10:35 2004 UTC
	- fixed installation location of Sendmail::Milter; it was quite wrong
		(reported by SL <milter@free.fr>)

	- [923158] made installation of Sendmail::Milter layer optional
	- [925579] added support for experimental setsender() operation
	- fixed usage of max_interpreters and max_requests values
		(they were being ignored previously)
	- allowed for named configuration variables to prefork_dispatcher()
	- [1002122] fixed symbol table to return symbols from earlier
		callbacks as appropriate (reported by <s.barnes@uni-koeln.de>)
	- [1003308] changed "EOF in stream" handling to exit as if a normal
		SMFIC_CLOSE had been received from the MTA
	- fixed warning in Context.pm wrt <= on an undefined value
	- [1003307] fixed ithread_dispatcher share() usage and warning
		appearing when $@ was defined but empty
	- [1003304] changed SIGINFO/SIGUSR1 handler to use warn() rather
		than raw prints to STDERR (requested by <andrewr@iagu.net>)
	- [925577, 1003351] added support for quarantine(), progress(),
		and shutdown() (Sendmail 8.13 special case)
	- moved SMFIF_* constants not in the standard Sendmail::Milter

		passed away of complications related to spina bifida.

0.93  Thu Mar 25 19:15:00 2004 UTC
	- fixed call to threads::shared::share() to pass varglob, not
		reference (reported by <schaefer@zanshin.com>)
		(also fixed in 0.92_01)
	- [910599] fixed SIGINFO handler to use only a valid signal; will use
		SIGUSR1 if SIGINFO doesn't exist
		(also fixed in 0.92_01)
	- [910602] always send a response to the close packet if the socket
		is still valid (was doing this for failures, but not for
		successful closing of the session)
	- [923156] moved constants from Sendmail::PMilter to Sendmail::Milter
		to allow the libmilter implementation to coexist

		(also fixed in 0.91_02)

		Sendmail::Milter::setdbg() as no-ops; needed for completeness
		(also fixed in 0.91_03)
